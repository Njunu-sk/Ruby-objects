Duck-Typing
Ruby relies less on the type or class of an object and more on its capabilities.
Duck typing means that an object is defined by what it can do, not by what it is.
Duck typing refers to the tendency of Ruby to be less concerned with the class of an object and more concerned with what methods can be called on it and what operations can be performed on it.

If an object walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then its a duck.
